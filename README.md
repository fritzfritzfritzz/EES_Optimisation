# Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning solution for optimizing solar energy usage and reducing grid costs in private households. The main objective is to maximize the utilization of solar energy through a smart battery optimizer, minimizing reliance on the grid and reducing electricity bills. The system dynamically adjusts the charging and discharging of the battery based on energy demand, solar generation, and grid prices.


# Data 
The data used in this repository can be found on the [SMARD.de](https://www.smard.de/home) database. 

# Key Features
* Intelligent battery optimization for maximizing solar energy usage
* Real-time monitoring of energy demand, solar generation, and grid prices
* Automatic adjustment of battery charging and discharging based on energy dynamics
* Cost savings by minimizing reliance on the grid and optimizing battery usage
* Reduction of carbon footprint through increased use of clean energy sources
* Reliable and sustainable energy supply for private households

# Getting Started
* Clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running 
 ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
